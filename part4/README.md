# Part 4: Optimizing schedules, allocations and plans through multiple programming models with Nerav Doshi

Learn to use tools to develop DO models - There are plenty of tools on the market to develop and solve optimization models, including some open source ones.
IBM offers two ways to start learning DO at no cost: **Decision Optimization for Watson Studio (DO for WS)** and **CPLEX Optimization Studio (COS)**.
